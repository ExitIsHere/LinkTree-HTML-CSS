LinkTree HTML/CSS

Made by a 14-year-old dev (btw thatâ€™s me ðŸ˜‰)

ðŸ“– What I Built

This is my own LinkTree-style page, created with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
The goal was to have all my important links (like Discord, TikTok, InGame trackers, etc.) in one place â€“ but with my own design and code.

Itâ€™s not just a basic static page: I added scripts and styling to make it more interactive and fun to use.


---

ðŸŽ¨ Features

Built only with HTML, CSS & JS (no frameworks).

Clean layout with hover effects and animations.

Simple structure thatâ€™s easy to edit and expand.

Works in every browser, since itâ€™s just static files.

ðŸ”§ Why I Made This

I wanted a project to practice coding basics and test my own ideas.
Instead of using ready-made stuff like LinkTree, I built everything myself so I understand every part of it.

ðŸš€ Try It Yourself

If you want, you can clone the repo and use it for yourself. Copy this command into your terminal:
```bash
# Copy this command into your terminal
git clone https://github.com/ExitIsHere/LinkTree-HTML-CSS.git
```
Then just open index.html in your browser.
After that, you can edit the links, change the design, or add more scripts to make it your own.
