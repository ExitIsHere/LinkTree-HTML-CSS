# LinkTree HTML/CSS

*Made by a 14-year-old dev (btw thatâ€™s me ðŸ˜‰)*

## ðŸ“– What I Built

This is my own **LinkTree clone**, created with **HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript**.  
The goal was to have all my important links (like Discord, TikTok, InGame Trackers, etc.) in one place â€“ but with my own design and code.

Itâ€™s not just a basic static page: I added some scripts and styling to make it more interactive and fun to use.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

- Built with **pure HTML, CSS & JS**.  
- Custom layout with hover effects and animations.  
- Organized structure thatâ€™s easy to change and expand.  
- Works in any browser, since itâ€™s just static files.

## ðŸ”§ Why I Made This

I wanted a project where I can practice **front-end coding** and try out my own ideas.  
Instead of using ready-made stuff like LinkTree, I built everything myself so I understand every part of it.
